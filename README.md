### Task A

Print the last 10 prime numbers from 300 milion number range using Eratosthenes algorithm over a bit field to use minimal amount of memory

### Task B

Decode a secret message from the .ppm file using bit field functions from task A

## Project 2

14.5/15 points

### TASK A

Implement your own tail function (prints last n number of lines in a given file)

### TASK B

Rewrite C++ file (wordcount.cc) in C (wordcount.c) using hash table functions as a substitute for unordered_map C++ feature
